            <h3>Users:</h3>
            Here are the users in this project:
            <ol type = "1">
                <li>DBA</li>
                <li>Middle-level user</li>
                <li>Casual and naive user</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>DBA:</h3>
            <p>
                The database admin is one of the key users of the database. The role of DBA is becoming an increasingly 
                important one with the information driven environment of today. Database admin is responsible for understanding 
                and managing the overall database environment by developing, implementing and maintaining a blueprint to follow 
                when deploying databases in the organization.
                A database admin determines the structure of the database and how data is stored within the database. 
                They must also constantly monitor various resources. Without the DBA's oversight, slowdowns, downtime 
                and system outages will inevitably occur. This is not ideal especially in a business environment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Middle-leve user:</h3>
            <p>
                The employees are the middle level users. Their main function revolves around listening to the passenger's needs and 
                requesting the DBA for changes in the Passengers information if required. They can also use the database for extracting  
                passengers' information  for enhancement of the passenger's experience. 
	            After getting permission from the DBA, the employees in the managerial positions can use the database for managing the 
                employees details. Their job includes   constantly querying and updating the database, using standard types of queries and 
                updates that have been carefully programmed and tested. 
	            Another important function of the middle-level users is the management of each flight, that is required for the smooth functioning of the airlines.
            </p>

            <h3>Casual and naive user:</h3>
            <p>
                Casual user:
                These are the users who occasionally access the database but they require different information each time. 
                They use a sophisticated database query language basically to specify their request and are typically middle or 
                level managers or other occasional browsers

                Naive user:
                Clerks in any bank is a naive user because they don't have any DBMS knowledge but they still use the database and perform their given task.
