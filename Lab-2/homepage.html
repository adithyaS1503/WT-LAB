            <p>
                Emirates is the most popular airline in the world. Emirates has a very comprehensive
                intuitive website but it can be better. A lot of accessibility features are still missing in 
                a lot of airlines and including thest features will make the experience of the passenger much
                better and won't retract from the experience of those users or passengers who don't have use of
                those features.

                Emirates Airlines Management System maintains the data about the airlines, their staff, the passengers, and booking details. 
                Booking a ticket should be a seamless process for the passenger. It must not be intimidating and building a website that 
                accomplishes these tasks is necessary for improving user experience.
                Therefore, this project will improve the existing website of Emirates and polish the booking and flight experience of the passenger.
